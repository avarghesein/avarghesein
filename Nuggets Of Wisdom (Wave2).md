## Art Of Souls - Nuggets Of Wisdom (Wave2)

    Not all Scars finds a Soothing Solace,
    Not every Dusk leads to another Sunrise.
    And not all Roads find Dawn's Gilded Trace,
    Nor all Tales unravel Truth's Embrace.
  <br/>
  
    Yet on The Wings Of Celestial Grace,
    We're granted another Rise.
    Where Triumphant echoes our Destined Decree,
    Victory's flame Guides the path We See.
  <br/>

    We go tight, 
    Yes, We do fight, 
    Yet through all of it, 
    There is one thing,
    That will never change, 
    We're friends forever;
  <br/>
  
    In each Whispered Deed, a Seed is Sown,
    Though faint, its Echo Whispers Future's Tone.
    Ponder deep before Your steps are Spun,
    For every Act, A Tale is begun.
  <br/>
  
    A Promise, Once made,
    Is always A Promise;
    And It is nothing but,
    Eternity and Beyond !
  <br/>
  
    Seeking Kindled Souls To Mend,
    Since Old Ones into Admirers Transcend;
  <br/>

    In Time's Gentle Cadence,
    You'll recall Your former Essence.
  <br/>  
  
    The Rain has Come Again,
    While We Were Dancing;
  <br/>  
 
    A pretty Face may bring You momentary Glory,
    But a Good Heart always brings You,
    The Zeal Of Eternity.
  <br/>

    Attraction is Momentary,
    Affection stays a While,
    And Love endures Forever.
  <br/>

    Love, Peace, and Happiness,
    The Seraphic pursuits Of Heaven.
    Constantly being in them,
    Is to Enchant Your Soul and Life into it;
  <br/>
  
    Look into The Mirror,
    Not for Who You Are,
    But for What You Ought to be.
  <br/>
  
    Changing Your History Is;
    Changing Your Present.
  <br/>

    Now I Know My Name,
    Now I Know The Way I searched,
    The Life I sought,
    I found Myself.
  <br/>
  
    I was just waiting outside,
    The moment You Said Yes,
    I AM in;
    And I feel Home.
  <br/>
