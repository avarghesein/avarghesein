## Art Of Souls - Nuggets Of Wisdom (Wave2)

    Not all Scars finds a Soothing Solace,
    Not every Dusk leads to another Sunrise.
    And not all Roads find Dawn's Gilded Trace,
    Nor all Tales unravel Truth's Embrace.
  <br/>
  
    Yet on The Wings Of Celestial Grace,
    We're granted another Rise.
    Where Triumphant echoes our Destined Decree,
    Victory's flame Guides the path We See.
  <br/>

    We go tight, 
    Yes, We do fight, 
    Yet through all of it, 
    There is one thing,
    That will never change, 
    We're friends forever;
  <br/>
  
    In each Whispered Deed, a Seed is Sown,
    Though faint, its Echo Whispers Future's Tone.
    Ponder deep before Your steps are Spun,
    For every Act, A Tale is begun.
  <br/>

    Seeking Kindled Souls To Mend,
    Since Old Ones into Admirers Transcend;
  <br/>
