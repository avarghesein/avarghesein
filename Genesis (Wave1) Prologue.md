## Art Of Souls - Part I - Prologue
    Lord always remains in a Perfect State Of,
    Peace and Happiness;
    He planned a Grant Scheme Of Events,
    To Exalt The State Of,
    Infinite Peace, Happiness and Heavenly Rest;
    (Genesis 2/2)
    So To Be in The 7th Heaven; 

    Though Lord Has No Finite Form,
    He Took The Form Of Trinity,
    In The Beginning,
    The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    To Have His Offspring in His Image;
    (Genesis 1/27)

    With His Impeccable Wisdom,
    He Brought Forth His Offspring,
    The Angels;
    The Number Of Them is in finite;

    The Creation Of This Physical Universe,
    Was Not In the Original Scheme Of Events,
    Until The Fall Of Angels.

    The Fallen Angel Insisted,
    To scrutinize The Loyalty Of His New Offspring,
    In a Simulated Environment,
    Which is the Physical Universe;
    Now The Offspring is No More Called an Angel,
    But A Soul. (Psalm 8 / 5).
    A Soul will Attain A Status Of an Angel,
    Once He Conquers the Snares Of Evil.

    Hence The Physical Universe has been Created;
    The Design was A Combined Effort,
    Of Both Angels and the Devils;
    However the Lion-Share Of The System Design,
    Has been asked and Owned by The Serpent,
    As He is the One Who wants the Tests.
    (John 14 / 30)

    The One Agreement which was put forth By The Serpent,
    Was, No Parties (Angels/ Devils),
    Should Directly Intervene with The Souls,
    In The Physical Plane.
    This is another Snare Of Evil,
    To Intensify The Tests On The Souls,
    And Named it As the Free-Will;

    With the Infinite Wisdom Of Lord,
    The Angels has Circumvented This Barrier By,
    Introducing the “Language Of Souls”,
    In the Spiritual Garden Of Eden,
    To Effectively Communicate with Souls,
    To Help Them, 
    To Know Their Purpose,
    And Direct Them in The Right Course.

    This is the Skill,
    To Communicate with The Heavens,
    Lost By the Souls,
    (Genesis 3 / 23)
    With The Sin Of The First Spiritual Adam/Eve. 

    This is the Same Skill,
    Reintroduced To Souls By Jesus,
    By Submitting himself,
    To the Heavens Will;
    So That Souls Can Now,
    Walk In LIGHT To Their,
    Ultimate Destiny;

    The Strategy Of the Serpent,
    Is Straightforward;
    It Put its Weeds
    (As it Did during the Origin Of Creations)
    Along with Your Thoughts;

    Now Two Things Happens;

    Either You Succumbed To those Thoughts,
    Thinking Its Your Intuitions;
    And Become a Slave to the Serpent;
    Or Your Soul Get Insulted,
    By Yourself For Those Thoughts;
    (Romans 7 / 15 – 24),
    Though You Don’t Commit Any Sin Physically.

    The Very Moment,
    When You Dissect The Weeds,
    From Your Own Thoughts,
    And Able to Burn Them,
    (Matthew 13 / 40 - 43)
    Your Journey To Your Higher Self,
    Begins...
