## Art Of Souls - An Intro To The Language Of Souls

    Lord Left no traces,
    Post the incident at the Spiritual Garden,
    Where the first Spiritual Adam n Eve
    Preferred their privacy over His presence.
    However He reveals himself to the Chosen Ones,
    To the new Adam n Eves,
    In all what they do, Through The “Language Of Souls”;

    From The beginning of time,
    For The Chosen Souls,
    GOD has arranged the paths They should go,
    The objects They should see,
    Even in which angle, orientation,
    In what time, with how much light,
    With what group of other objects

    Of course you could imagine,
    Those objects itself are in its current shape by
    A thousand year of transformation / Evolutions-
    Even Man Made Objects.
    The very specific design of your eyes,
    Its focal length, age related changes,
    And the list is infinite and he shows
    His image through all of them;

    In essence, He takes all kinds of forms at once; 
    Those who are uninitiated,
    They call it as "Pareidolia";
    This is the base language in the group of
    "The Languages Of Souls";

    As time passes by,
    You should be able to correlate things better,
    Based on the previous paths,
    The people, places, pictures, music, arts or objects
    - To name a few - Which you’ve visited or trodden. 

    Once you start excelling in that,
    Other improved version of the same,
    Will be presented to you;
    Say You start coding in C++, 
    While you are still good at C.
    
    All Algorithms, Language Models,
    Even The Artificial Intelligence,
    Which We See today in Every Places,
    Are working towards that Single Purpose;

    Learning a language takes time.
    Consider C++ in Computers,
    How long it may take to master it?
    2 years? 4 years?
    If it's a computer language,
    Imagine how long it will take
    To learn a language of higher dimensions.
    Humans cannot,
    But if Heavens wills,
    It will be installed to your Mind in Phases,
    In My knowledge it took more than 15 years for Me

    A painstaking process though,
    Where You will be pulled through,
    An unfavorable set of events,
    Circumstances and people.
    
    In each phase Heavens will help and ask for
    Your permission to move on to next phases.
    A never ending learning process,
    Just as how Heavens are designed.
