## Art Of Souls - Part I

    To Every One, Who wants to know Why evil
    and inequality (of all sorts) exists in the World (except Man Made).

    The Word Of God Matthew 13:25,
    has an Universal Applicability.

    The Parable does not simply refers to
    mere Seeds Or Weeds,
    But EVERY ELEMENTS OF COSMOS.

    Even the Basic Building Blocks of The Universe the Quarks,
    The DNAs of Species and the Entire Universe Evolution has been Affected
    (This has much deeper meaning, if you contemplate) by
    the Weeds sowed by the Devil, from the very Beginning of TIME.

    Find no other reason than This,
    If you confront with discrepancies even in the Scripture.

    GOD did allowed this, because
    HE has given free will to everyone including Devil
    and just to show that, How evil looks like
    and what is the true face of Satan.

    In essence, The Universe and The Evolution, we're seeing Today,
    is not the one Which The Lord has envisaged,
    before HE has created The TIME/SPACE.

    This is why, its being Said:
    "GOD didn't Invent Death - Wisdom 1 / 13 - 15".

    In the end (Matthew 13:30),
    every evil will get wiped out,
    and only the SEEDs will be collected in the barn
    (Kingdom of Heaven)

    That is the Parallel Universe (a.k.a Paradise), GOD has originally planned,
    and can come to an existence through a single correction
    in the Basic Cosmic Elements (which can happen in a blink of an eye).
    It will reverse Everything back to its Original intended form.

    The same thing, The Apostles tries to convey in 1 Corinthians 15:52. "In a flash,
    in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet,
    the dead will be raised Imperishable, and we will be changed"
    
    The Righteousness Of The Lord,
    Has also rightfully sealed,
    The Ultimate Fate Of Satan,
    For its most perfidious Desires, 
    (Isaiah 14 / 14)
    Who will be Replaced By Super Souls,
    Whom Dwells in Each Other;
    And Reflects The True Image Of GOD,
    The Extended Holy Trinity;

    However that Particular Hour or Moment is only known to Our Heavenly Father (Matthew 24 / 36)

    While we are hoping towards The Rapture, There is nothing wrong in connecting with Worldly Things.
    However, A GOD's Child should be knowing What to Pick, and What to Leave.

    If you need Guidance,
    Holy Spirit can talk to you in Unimaginable ways,
    Even through Worldly Things right in front of you
    and in fact show you the consequences (Future) of
    any action you are going to take...
