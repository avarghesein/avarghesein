## Art Of Souls - Part II

    Souls have had existed in Eternity.
    The Pre Universe era.
    Where there were No Dimensions.

    There are no known limits to a SOUL,
    Than The Hardware,
    In which it is currently encompassed.

    However, You could achieve
    An Ultimate manifestation,
    Through the right amount of tweaks though.

    You will appreciate A Soul,
    Within a Heavenly Body,
    Only If you’ve experienced it,
    Within a Low End Hardware;
    This is why Evolutions have been Designed by Heavens.

    Like a Software Program,
    Which Get Downloaded and Installed,
    Lord Waited Till that Point in The Evolution,
    Where Our Material Body Could Hold the Souls.
    This is Why Its Being Said,
    We’ve Given The Treasure,
    In An Earthly Vessel.

    For Chosen Souls,
    Reincarnations are an undeniable Truth;
    Where even Jesus Proclaimed,
    Baptist John is the Elijah to Come;
    (Matthew 11 / 14),
    And They will Come Again,
    The two Olive Trees,
    The two Lamp-stands, 
    For They will stand before the Lord of All the earth.
    (Revelation 11 / 4)

    The Big Picture,
    First Coming,
    [Spiritual Adam]---[…]---[Abraham]---[…]---[New Adam: First Coming : Jesus]
    Second Coming (End Of Age),
    [Second Adam: Jesus]---[…]---[Second: Abraham]---[…]---[Second Coming: Jesus]

    Before The Second Coming,
    Every Temptation Succumbed To,
    Every Sin Committed,
    The Time has to be Replayed,
    The Soul has to Over Come It,
    The Ramifications Of the Original Sins,
    Has to Be Reverted,
    By Spiritually Owning the Outcomes.
    Since Jesus Came Sinless,
    You have to be Perfect,
    For Your Father Is Perfect;

    The time-frame is non linear,
    Considering TWIN FLAMES and Super Souls,
    For They will Work together and Redeem each other(s),
    Which Shows Lord’s Impeccable Mercy;
    This is Why It has been Said,
    No one knows The Day or Hour,
    Not even the Angels in heaven;

    When its Time,
    No matter Which Culture/Belief You Are Born Into,
    If You’re The Chosen,
    The True Spirit (The Reincarnated) will Start Manifesting itself;

    Now The Question Is,
    Who AM I (YOU)?
