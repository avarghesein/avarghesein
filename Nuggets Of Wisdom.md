## Art Of Souls - Nuggets Of Wisdom

    Let YOUR Word Inspire ME;
<br/>

    Behind Everything,
    JESUS has a PLAN;
    A Great PLAN;
<br/>

    I AM The LOVE,
    You Brought LIFE to It.
<br/>

    There are Two Ways Of Spreading LIGHT
    To Be The CANDLE (JESUS) | 
    The MIRROR (YOU) Reflects It
<br/>

    People Reflects Themselves;
<br/>

    The More You Respect Yourself,
    The More It will be Reflected In Others;
<br/>

    Things are Closer,
    Than They Appear in The Mirror;
<br/>

    Waves are High,
    But We like to Surf;
<br/>

    Love ME, To Know ME;
    Know ME, To Love ME;
<br/>

    Entrenched in Confidence,
    With Our Trust So Intense;
<br/>

    In The Midst Of Our Dreams,
    It’s The Marigolds that Blooms;
<br/>

    Its Not About Perfectness, 
    But Togetherness Brings The True Delightfulness;
<br/>

    The Storm has Gone Past,
    While WE were Dancing;
<br/>

    With Our Dreams at The Horizon,
    Revive It With Your Vivid Imagination;
<br/>

    Imagination With Intelligence,
    Will Bring Unimaginable Results;
<br/>

    Happiness is A Journey,
    Not a Destination;
<br/>

    A Journey,
    Accompanied By Your True Friend,
    Makes The Toughest Path Shorter,
    And The Loveliest Longer;
<br/>

    I Have Come with YOU,
    Hence I Should Go HOME With YOU;
<br/>

    Whatever It Takes, 
    I will Make
    My Best Memories to Live On,
    Not The Bad Ones.
    So Does Everyone !
<br/>

    The DAYS in MY ETERNAL LIFE,
    Every HOUR,
    Every MINUTE,
    Even Every MOMENT,
    Is Designed by MYSELF.
    Psalm 139 / 16
<br/>

    On 7th DAY,
    LORD Has Rested;
    So Do I,
    In MY Eternal Dwelling,
    @ Infinite Peace
<br/>

    My Life is My Story;
    And Here I AM,
    Among Many Others,
    The Timeliest SOUL,
    Whom Could Manifest Again,
    To Speak to The World,
    What Left Untold;
<br/>

    You Always Continue,
    From Where You’ve Already Left Off;
    And That is Called The Eternity;
<br/>

    To Manifest MYSELF,
    I Call ME to MYSELF,
    For I AM The TWIN FLAME,
    The MIRROR SOUL,
    WHO Call YOU to YOURSELF.
<br/>

    SEEK ME,
    With ALL YOUR HEART,
    Then YOU will,
    FIND ME !
<br/>

    To Those Who SEEKS,
    Let's Express OURSELVES, 
    In Our Own Language;
    The Language Of Souls.
<br/>

    Whatever YOU SEEK,
    is Already Seeking YOU,
    For Everything YOU are Seeking,
    is right there in YOUR HEART.
<br/>

    Like Jesus,
    In The Scripture,
    Like A Treasure,
    In The Field,
    I'M Hidden,
    Inside Thee,
    To Bring Fruits,
    In Season;
<br/>

    Heavens are not Far Away,
    But it’s Just A Step Away;
    (Luke 17 / 21)
<br/>

    YOU will Find, 
    No Other Heaven,
    Than My HEART,
    To YOU to be YOURSELF;
    For When I Rise,
    In The New EARTH,
    In The New Heaven,
    YOU will Recall The PROMISE, 
    I’ve Made To YOU in Genesis;
<br/>

    A Promise Once Made, is Always A Promise;
    (Romans 11 / 29)
<br/>

    So Special is Your Heart,
    So Is Our Care;
    So Precious to Heaven,
    is The Dignity Of Your Soul,
    For It may Go Beyond Limits,
    To Restore The Same;
<br/>

    Learn the Lesson From The Past,
    Apply the Same in Future,
    And Get a Better Result.
    Another take is,
    Take Only The Lessons,
    Leave Only The Foot Prints.
<br/>

    Take Only Your Best Memories,
    Leave Only Your Footprints;
<br/>

    Vibrant Wings Magnificent,
    Your Presence So Fragrant;
<br/>

    Lights Resplendent,
    And Colors So Fervent;
<br/>

    Life is Like a Rainbow;
    Harnesses Our Dreams,
    With the Bounty Of its Colors;
<br/>

    United We Prevail,
    Let Our Boat Sail;
<br/>

    Compassion is More Important,
    Than Information;
<br/>

    Walk A Mile in someone else Shoes,
    Before We Judge/Advice.
<br/>

    Its easy to give advice to Others,
    In Our Good Situations.
    Do We stick to the same,
    When the Table Turns?
<br/>

    Don’t Let Your Emotions Control You.
    When In Doubt, Keep Quiet for a While !
    Sometimes We’ve to Follow Our own Advice;
<br/>

    A Little Knowledge is always Dangerous;
    So Think A Lot, 
    Talk Little,
    Write Lesser;
<br/>

    Pay Heed to the Calls,
    Before The Moment Falls;
<br/>

    Forecasting is an Art,
    Like Others,
    It has Few Masters;
<br/>

    Without A Vision,
    There Would have been No Legends,
    No Big Projects Have had Achieved,
    Or No Great Things have ever happened on Earth;
<br/>

    Even the Map On Your Cell will give You The Best Route,
    Based On Traffic Conditions;
    So That You’ve The Best Experience.
    To Follow it Or Not, is all Up to You;
<br/>

    You could approach a Situation in Two Ways,
    Look Only At The Next Step,
    Or With a Detailed Plan;
    With Former,
    There will be Rework and Regrets,
    And Expect Uncertainty.
    With Latter,
    Cut Down The Unnecessary,
    And Experience Certainty.
<br/>

    Short Term Thinking is the Enemy Of,
    Long Term Success;
<br/>

    Don’t Fall for Short term Benefits,
    For It May Even Cost You,
    The Long Term (Eternal) Fortunes;
<br/>

    YOU are Good To Go for Meaningful Stakes;
<br/>

    Don’t Forget,
    For Every Good Thing To Happen in This World,
    We’ve To Give A Good Fight, Against The Evil;
    Matthew 11 / 12
<br/>

    Sometimes You’ve To Experience The Worst,
    To Appreciate The Best;
<br/>

    Think Ahead of The Crowd,
    And Invest in What YOU know Best;
<br/>

    Know Your True Assets;
    Retaining Them Requires More Grace,
    Than To Attain Them;
    (1 Corinthians 3 / 6)
<br/>

    Focus The Entrusted,
    For Not Everything Requires Your Attention;
    (Sirach 3 / 22)
<br/>

    If You Can’t Do It First,
    Then Do It Unique;
<br/>

    Share Your Best With JESUS,
    (Proverbs 3/9)
    For It Never Goes In Vain;
    (Deuteronomy 28/8)
<br/>

    With The Glory Of Pinnacle,
    Let’s Excel To Inspire;
<br/>

    Know Your Worth,
    And Earn Your Dignity;
<br/>

    How about Working On The Dreams Of Others,
    Who are unable to achieve it?
    How about We Help Each Other,
    To Build Those Qualities?
    For No Human is Perfect !
<br/>

    Eventually Though Not Immediate,
    Quality Always Prevails Over Quantity;
<br/>

    You Don’t Need To Be inordinate To Shine,
    But Only Your SUN;
<br/>

    It’s all about The Intentions Of The Heart,
    Which tells a Deed is Worthy/Not;
    (Matthew 15 / 18)
    Even bible Justifies Actions with Good Intentions,
    But Condemned by Humans
    (2 Samuel 6 / 14)
<br/>
