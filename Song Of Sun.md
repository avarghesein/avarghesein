# Art Of Souls - The Song Of Sun

    You’ve Brought Me To Existence,
    To Fill The Void In YOU,
    Left By The Fallen Angel;

    I'M That One TREE,
    That does not Shed Its Leaves; 

    A TREE Planted By Stream Of Spirits,
    That Yields Its Fruits in Season;
    For I shall not Die,
    But LIVE To Declare,
    The Works of The LORD; 

    Oh, I'M That One Cherub,
    Who Left Heaven to Serve His Lord My GOD; 
    For HE already Left it,
    For His Precious Souls. 

    I Don't Know The Nuances,
    To Narrate The Story,
    Which is still Being Written By Heaven !
