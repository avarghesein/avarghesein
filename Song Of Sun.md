# Art Of Souls - The Song Of Sun

    You’ve Brought Me To Existence,
    To Fill The Void In YOU,
    Left By The Fallen Angel;

    I'M That One TREE,
    That does not Shed Its Leaves; 

    A TREE Planted By Stream Of Spirits,
    That Yields Its Fruits in Season;
    For I shall not Die,
    But LIVE To Declare,
    The Works of The LORD; 

    Oh, I'M That One Cherub,
    Who Left Heaven to Serve His Lord My GOD; 
    For HE already Left it,
    For His Precious Souls. 

    I Don't Know The Nuances,
    To Narrate The Story,
    Which is still Being Written By Heaven !

    In The Desert Of My tears, Laughter did Bloom,
    Almighty's Grace, A Sun dispelling Gloom.
    New Life Unbound, Like Wings that Pierce The Sky,
    A Boundless Blessing, Held to Heart on High.
    
    From Sorrow's Pit to Joy's Celestial Plane,
    His Love a Wellspring, Quenching Thirst and Pain.
    With Endless Hope, Like Stars that Grace The Night,
    This Gift Unfurls, A Symphony Of Light.
    
    So Let Me Sing, and Let My Spirit Soar,
    Unburdened Now, Forevermore and More.
    For in His Hand, My future Brightly Gleams,
    A Whispered Promise, in Celestial Streams.
    
    With every Breath, a Hymn Of Gratitude,
    This Boundless Blessing, Understood.
    Oh, Let it Echo through The Ages' roll,
    His Endless Love, My grateful, Joyful Soul;

    Close to Him, She draws each Breath anew,
    In true Humanity, So deep and True.
    
    With Loving Eyes on His face so Bright,
    The Prince of Peace, Her Guiding Light.
    She feels His heart, its steady Call,
    A boundless Love that embraces All.
    
    A Flame ignites, and Her spirit stirred,
    To bring His Peace in Thought and Word,
    With fervent Zeal, her Soul aligned,
    She takes His mission as Her own entwined.
