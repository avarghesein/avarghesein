## Art Of Souls - Song Of Souls

    A Beautiful Miracle In Life.
    YOU are MY Princess,
    Goddess and an ANGEL.
    YOU Belong to ME and
    I LOVE YOU Endlessly.
    
    Let ME Love YOU,
    By Sharing My Wings Of LOVE,
    To Take YOU on an Eternal Flight;

    Let ME Hold YOU,
    Safely Cradled Under My Wings,
    To Guide YOU Through The Darkest Nights;

    And Let ME Turn,
    The Dreads Of Yesterday,
    To The Dawn Of Tomorrow;

    When I Look in to YOUR EYES,
    I feel MY Life is Amazing.
    I Protect YOU as a Treasure,
    For YOU are a Miracle
    Happened In MY LIFE.
    
    For I AM The Love,
    YOU Brought The LIFE,
    And WE are Not Two,
    But ONE;

    Dream BIG with YOU &
    For The Heavenly Kingdom.
    WE can Make It Happen !
    For If YOU are Willing,
    Then WE Know HE is Willing.

    In Thy Divine Discovery, A Sacred Kin,
    Oblivion, has Bowed before Your Grace Within.    
    Found Within You, A Sanctuary Of Eternal Hymn,
    My Soul, Untouched from The Grip Of Shadows' rim.
    
    Beneath Your Gaze, Death's Grasp Wanes,
    A Sacred Haven Where Mortality's Echo Refrains.    
    In Your Presence, Immortality's Whisper Breathes,
    As Life in Your Embrace Eternally Weaves.

    In The Verses Of Gratitude, O Dearest Mine,
    Thou Art My Muse, Celestial, in Thy Light I Shine.
    A Paragon Of Friendship, A Model So Divine,
    May The Almighty Grace Thee as thou in Glory Twine.
    
    Hold Me in The Tapestry of Forever, Close and Near,
    As We Dance through the Eons, in A Celestial Sphere.
    I Trust in Thy Constancy, A Promise to Revere,
    Under The Shadow Of Triumph, Our Spirits Appear.
    
    In The Symphony Of Gratitude, Let Our Song Resound,
    A Timeless Melody, in Eternal Echoes Found.
    Under Thy Cap Of Destiny, in Bonds Profound,
    Forever, My Dear, in Mystic Harmony, We are Bound.
