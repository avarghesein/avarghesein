## Art Of Souls - Part II - Prologue

    As a continuation to our earlier discussion,
    This Universe is merely a Mirror,
    Which reflects the Events in the Higher Plane.

    All the Good things happening around the World,
    is the Heaven’s way of telling its Secrets to the Human Souls.

    For e.g. Let’s Correlate the same with
    The Developments in the Information Technology.

    Like a “SOUL” which cannot be seen, but only Sensed,
    So does a “SOFTWARE”.

    Like a “BODY” which can be Seen or Manifested
    in its Dimensions, so Does a “HARDWARE”.

    Physical or Heavenly Bodies resemble Hardware of varying Capabilities.
    You can have a very simplistic IoT Chip to a Simple SoC (RaspberryPI)
    or a Petascale supercomputer
    (Where the Computational Power is more than a quadrillion FLOPS)

    Like a Physical Body,
    Hardware could take a fixed form factor,
    have a fixed LifeSpan and limited capability in terms of Peripherals,
    Speed Of Its Computations and Maximum Memory It can Hold.

    It can only have a finite instruction set, embedded into its Chip (DNA),
    which does everything it could through
    a simple way of (Addition, Multiplication and Division or related).

    However, A SOUL resembles SOFTWARE, which is Limitless.
    It can be as simple as an Assembly Language to a Program which Powers
    the trending ChatGPT Models (AI/Machine Learning,
    NLP, Neural Network Models to name a few).

    The same software can run on a Normal PC (Physical Body)
    or a Supercomputer in Cloud (Your Heavenly Body).
    Whichever hardware on which it will be put on to run,
    the Manifestation Power will be according to
    the capabilities of the Underlying Hardware.

    Like a Distributed Computational Model
    (Where the same Software have spanned over
    different Hardware’s and Coordinates with each other),

    Certain Chosen and Elated Souls, will be spanned
    over multiple Physical or Heavenly bodies
    (the simplest form is the TWIN FLAMES or MIRROR SOUL)
    in the same timeframe (You’re said to be extremely fortunate,
    if you could meet yours) or in a totally different timeframe, and place.

    This implies that, Your Mirror Soul reflects you to Others
    where You cannot.
    You may be in a situation where you cannot manifest well to others,
    but Your Mirror Soul might be extremely superior
    with such capabilities and could sense/detect and mirror
    You and Your Inner Self to Others, if required.

    This is one of the blessings bestowed to Mirror Souls.
    So you could communicate with a Soul,
    By simply interacting with his/her Mirror Soul(s),
    where the essence of the interaction
    will be sensed by the original intended recipient.

    It's a version of "The Language of Souls",
    (Similar to a visual C++ program with pointers),
    Though many other customized variants occur,
    In accordance with the SOULS' needs.

    During the Next Age in Particular,
    Chosen Souls will be put into a single Heavenly Body,
    where you cannot distinguish individual Souls,
    but a Super Soul (Called Unisex Beings),
    which is the Union of all the elated Souls and
    comprising of all the capabilities of all the joined Souls.

    A Bird’s Eye View were we’ve just seen the tip of an ICE Berg
    or just scratched the Surface Of the Higher Secrets.
